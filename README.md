### A restaurant order assignment and delivery simulator that manages 4 branches of 1 restaurant
## Main Operation
An input file passes on the order list, along with parameters like the number of orders and delivery vehicles per restaurant.
The Program then produces an output file displaying the restaurant's performance and statistics on order delivery times.
The program can run in one of three modes: interactive, step-by-step or silent mode. Each requires different levels of interaction with the user
